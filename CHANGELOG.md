## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- The vocabulary's identity constructors agree between their two
  interpretations for every element. `Trace::zero_like`/`one_like`
  recorded `counted` leaves while `Tensor`'s hold `zero`/`one` —
  the same `from_count` divergence as the scan seeds, one level
  down and worse: five derivative rules call `one_like`, so for an
  element where `from_count(1)` is not `one` the recorded
  gradients themselves would drift from the engine's. `Trace` now
  records filled leaves of the engine's `zero` and `one`.

- The two reverse scans plant the same seed expressions for every
  element. `Tape::differentiate` seeded with `counted(shape, 1)`
  and minted non-ancestor zeros as `counted(shape, 0)` — the
  size-derived constants — while the engine scan plants `one_like`
  and `zero_like`; identical for the built-in elements, silently
  divergent for any element where `from_count` is not `one`/`zero`.
  Both recorded spellings now use the engine's `one` and `zero`,
  and the closure contract is pinned off `f64` by a `Bf16` case in
  the closure suite.

- `Plan::describe` and the live-volume accounting now tell the truth
  about a fused group's named results. An observed batch-norm mean
  or variance is written back by the group's action — materialized
  and readable — so its line reads `kept`, no longer `fused`; and
  `live_story`/`live_series` count the written-back statistics from
  the group's root onward instead of omitting them. Observing a
  named result costs no live volume (the write-back happens either
  way), which a new build-adaptive test pins along with the labels.
  The `Plan::patterns` doc no longer claims roots print as `fused`,
  and a stale intra-doc link in the window pattern points at
  `Tensor::windowed_product` again.

### Changed

- `Recordable` now spans the whole recordable operation set:
  `logsumexp` and `log_softmax` join the vocabulary. The two
  log-domain opcodes earned their seats on max-shifted bits, but
  no derivative rule happens to call them, so the trait — whose
  own doc says every member corresponds to something a tape can
  record — was the opcode set minus two, and no payload-generic
  algorithm could replay a spec containing them. Their stable
  forward bodies moved from the op files to inherent `Tensor`
  methods, where every other forward lives; `Trace` records the
  nodes. Out-of-tree `Recordable` impls gain two members.

- Kinship has one spelling. The origin-plus-coverage check a
  carrier makes when it meets a `Symbol` was written out six times
  — on `Tape`, `Network`, `Run`, `Field`, `Parameters`, and `Plan`
  — the same one-job-many-spellings shape the identity protocol
  was. A crate-internal `Kinship` now owns the check: one `locate`
  with the shared family message and each carrier's own coverage
  wording, and a `family` half for the slot-grained `Parameters`,
  whose coverage is the slot lookup. Every panic message is
  verbatim what it was; purely internal. The carrier-vs-carrier
  agreements (a parameter table against a network's slots) are a
  different check and keep their own spellings.

- `Fidelity` gained a third value, `Composed`, and the word stopped
  meaning two things. `BitIdentical` is now the absolute claim —
  the reference bits in every build, under either posture — and
  only the fused reduce-window walk makes it. The fused window
  product and batch-norm cells are `Composed`: exactly as faithful
  as the composition they replace, because their interiors consult
  the same chain, which is why they honor an `Exact` demand — the
  interior chain declines along with everything else. Admission is
  unchanged and still one comparison (`Composed` meets both
  demands, and demands remain the two postures' fidelities), so no
  election, plan, or bit changes anywhere.

- `Network::forward` — whole-spec evaluation, the proving road — now
  runs under `Numerics::Exact` by construction: the backend chain
  declines every task, so its bits are the reference bits, the same
  in every build and on every platform, and `Run::backward` on such
  a run differentiates exactly. `BoundEntry::interpret` now honors
  its entry's declared numerics posture (it previously ran under the
  ambient default whatever the entry declared), and every
  interpreter run records the posture it executed under, so
  `backward` re-enters exactly what the forward ran under. Compiled
  speed is untouched: plans keep the `Fast` default and the backend
  chain, and the `throughput` example's training phase moved to an
  engine-backward plan accordingly. Vision rule 3 and
  `docs/acceleration.md` now state the anchor precisely, and the
  new `numerics_tests` welds it: pinned digests of a product, a
  map, and a log-softmax loss that every feature build and platform
  must reproduce bit for bit on the exact roads.

### Added

- Forward mode, as the first out-of-tree AD mode
  (`examples/forward_mode.rs`): a `Dual` payload implementing
  `Recordable` — forward-mode knowledge is dual arithmetic, a
  payload, never a second rule body — replayed through the spec
  with `Opcode::express`. Over `Dual<Tensor>` the walk is an eager
  JVP; over `Dual<Trace>` it records the tangent computation as
  ordinary spec beside resolved sources. Graded bitwise: eager
  equals recorded, the directional derivative equals the reverse
  gradient contracted with the seed on a rational spec, and
  forward-over-reverse equals reverse-over-reverse on a
  Hessian-vector product — the recorded gradient is just more
  spec, so forward mode walks straight over it. Terminology gains
  **Replay** and **JVP** entries.

- The spec is executable IR, not only printable. `Opcode::express`
  computes or records one operation over any `Recordable` payload,
  and `Opcode::vjp` is the public name of the one derivative-rule
  body — so walking `Network::nodes` and expressing each opcode
  replays a frozen spec (over `Tensor` it is the interpreter, over
  `Trace` it re-records), and a reverse scan can be written from
  outside the crate against the crate's own rules, with the engine
  scan as its oracle. Sources panic ("supplied, not expressed");
  the opcode set stays closed — the surface applies rules, it does
  not define them. `tests/spec_surface.rs` welds all three
  readings: replay-over-tensors equals `Network::forward` bitwise,
  replay-over-traces re-records a spec whose `describe` matches
  byte for byte, and a public reverse scan matches `Run::backward`
  bitwise.

- `BatchNormTask::new` is public, for the same reason as
  `GemmTask::new` and `MapTask::new`: an out-of-tree element
  implementing `Elementary::batch_norm` builds the same validated
  tasks its differential tests need, closing the one hole in the
  `reference` module's promise that every hook grades exactly the
  way the in-crate ones are graded.

- The hand-maintained op tables are welded by test. `op_tests`
  constructs one instance of every `Op` variant — so a new variant
  breaks the list at compile time — and asserts the engine's
  `arity` agrees with `Opcode::arity`, that `is_source` names
  exactly the arity-0 variants, and that every read contract fits
  `Reads::operands`' width: the day an op outgrows the liveness
  array, the failure is a named test, not an index panic inside a
  caller's training-plan compile.

- The run-time half of dispatch is visible: `Backend::tallied(body)`
  runs any region — a plan run, a `backward`, a direct payload
  call, a whole training step — with a dispatch tally open and
  answers the collected `Service` rows: formula, precision, who
  served (with `None` naming the reference paths), and how many
  tasks landed there. Coverage declares *may*; the tally reports
  what *did*. Shaped like `Numerics::exactly` — a scoped closure,
  per thread, nested scopes capturing innermost — and free when no
  scope is open. The `throughput` example prints one step's tally
  (six products and a map, and which backend took them), the exact
  pinned-bits test now also asserts its roads tally only reference
  rows, and `service_tests` pins the row semantics in every build.

- The declared reading is public data. `Entry`'s four fields —
  `roots`, `observe`, `backward`, `numerics` — are public (the
  builder methods stay the construction road), and
  `BoundEntry::entry` borrows the declaration as the twin of
  `into_entry`. `Symbol::index` answers the position `describe`
  prints for nodes and operands, previously unreadable from the
  public IR view. `Parameters::payloads` is the slot-ordered
  table read, the parameter-grain twin of `Field::payloads`.
  `Tensor::as_constant` answers the fill value of a constant
  payload — a representation fact for O(1) displays and norms.
  The notebook tier composes through these reads alone: its last
  privileged accesses are gone, and every card is now
  hand-rollable from outside the crate. The new
  `tests/notebook_surface.rs` welds that claim — it compiles as
  an external consumer and rebuilds each card's data from the
  public readers.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- The gpt2 example generates through a one-token decode plan with
  per-layer KV caches carried by the caller (a second expression of
  the same parameters on the same tape; `scatter` appends the new
  rows over a position one-hot). Measured on an M1 Pro with
  `accelerate`: 18 ms/token f32 and 31 bf16 against the full-context
  loop's 193 and 341, token-identical text; the retained
  full-context loop is the `full` engine, and a plan test pins the
  two graphs bit-for-bit at toy scale.

- `Numerics`, the two-valued numerics posture on compile requests:
  `Request::numerics(Numerics::Exact)` makes the backend chain
  decline every task, so those runs compute on the built-in reference
  paths — the same bits as the default build, in every build — while
  `Fast` (the default) keeps the chain with its thresholds as cost
  heuristics. Runs carry the posture into `backward`, and an exact
  and a fast result are comparable in one process.
- StableHLO emission raises the recorded `BatchNorm` formulas to
  `stablehlo.batch_norm_training` / `batch_norm_inference`. The
  training raise returns the batch statistics as its own results, so
  observing the mean and variance no longer bars recognition; the
  primitive statistic reductions never cross the boundary. Raise-only:
  forward runs execute the recorded formulas unchanged.
- `Differentiable::is_counted`, the recognizer half of `counted`: a
  provided method certifying that a payload is exactly the
  size-derived constant `counted` mints. Pattern matchers use it to
  verify a recorded mean's divisor before raising; the conservative
  default answers `false` and only forgoes recognitions.
- StableHLO emission raises the canonical `max_pool` window fold to
  `stablehlo.reduce_window`: the unfolded lanes and the recorded
  `maximum` fold no longer cross the boundary as a static gather.
  The pattern is raise-only — forward runs execute the recorded fold
  unchanged, on every memory posture.

### Changed

- The `Keep` trait is `Detach`: `[w, x, loss].detach()`, the
  associated type `Detached`, and `Tape::record` bounding its closure
  on `Detach`. Construction's "names that leave the tape" and a plan's
  keep-set are different declarations, and one word for both was the
  observability muddle -- the execution keep-set keeps the name, and
  what construction does is detach. `use topos::Keep` becomes
  `use topos::Detach`.

- `Tensorial` is `Recordable`. The docs always called it the
  recordable vocabulary -- the operations a derivative rule may call,
  and nothing else -- while the name suggested a third payload kind
  beside `Tensor` and `Trace`, which is exactly the confusion the
  element seam forbids. The trait's members are unchanged; every
  `E: Tensorial` bound and `use topos::Tensorial` becomes
  `Recordable`.

- The pattern layer split into discovery and election: compilation
  pools every closed candidate once, posture-blind, and each consumer
  elects the entries its repertoire supports, so a partial-support
  consumer never claims a region it cannot use. Emission's repertoire
  is total, and engine-backward plans now raise window-GEMM groups to
  `stablehlo.convolution` exactly like forward plans — the old
  posture gate wrongly kept them primitive. Home fusion is unchanged
  on every posture.

- The window-GEMM match moved from ad-hoc `Plan` columns into a
  pattern catalog (`src/engine/pattern/`): one compiled column any
  number of patterns share, with home fusion and StableHLO raising as
  two actions on the same match. Same matches, same skips, same
  `describe` wording, same emitted modules, same bits.

- The spec and the state are now separate types, and the whole
  identity protocol is gone. Recording happens on the new public
  `Tape` (the construction phase: `leaf`, `parameter`, `input`,
  `resolve`, `differentiate`, and the `Value` operators);
  `tape.into_network()` consumes it and seals the recording into an
  immutable `Network` (structure, shapes, parameter initials, input
  defaults — no lock, no live state, shareable by `&`/`Arc`, not
  `Clone`); `network.parameters()` materializes the record-site
  initials into the caller-owned `Parameters` state. Training is pure
  data — `parameters = parameters.step(&gradients, rule)` (with
  `step_each` passing the parameter's `Symbol`) — replacing
  `Network::update`/`update_each`, and mints no new network, so
  generations no longer exist. Runs and plans take the state per
  call: `network.forward(&parameters, feeds)` (replacing
  `forward`/`forward_with`), `network.forward_for(&parameters,
  targets, feeds)`, and `plan.forward(&parameters, feeds)`.
  `network.into_tape()` consumes the network to reopen recording —
  linear by ownership, so divergent histories are unrepresentable —
  and `parameters.carried(&network)` moves state across the round
  trip; `parameters.of(symbol)` reads a payload,
  `parameters.with_payloads(...)` installs checkpoints. What-ifs are
  `parameters.clone()`: one spec, any number of states.

- The module tree now mirrors the stack, in four tiers under `src/`:
  `core` — the payload seam, the closed instruction set (`op`), the
  graph world (tape, network, parameters, fields, handles, the
  recording surface), and the `engine` that reads them (`Run`,
  `Plan`, and the forward entry points); `derived` — the backend
  chain and StableHLO emission, faster or foreign readings of the
  same spec; `facade` — the neural and notebook conveniences, which
  compose through the public surface alone; and the published
  `reference` kernels. The engine enum is `Op`, not `Function`: it
  is the instruction set, not an ML function and not a Rust `fn`.
  Purely internal: the crate root re-exports are unchanged.

- The compile request is `Request`, and its posture flag is
  `backward()`. `Compile` was the register's one verb-named type and
  stuttered at 57 of its 60 call sites
  (`network.compile(Compile::roots(...))`); the request now reads as
  English — `network.compile(Request::roots([loss]).backward())` —
  and the flag mirrors `Plan::can_backward` instead of leaning on
  the internal engine-versus-recorded vocabulary. (`training()` was
  rejected as the simplification because it would lie: the recorded
  route trains through forward-only plans.)

- Post-recording APIs speak `Symbol` only: `Run::of`,
  `Run::backward`, `Field::of`, `forward_for` targets, and
  `recorded_gradients` pairs take symbols, `Compile` is non-generic
  with roots and observes converting through `Into<Symbol>`, and
  `Tape::differentiate` (moved from `Network`) accepts values or
  symbols. A `Value` is construction-phase only — the borrow checker
  rejects one crossing the seal, and `.symbol()` is the bridge.

- The facades record on the tape: `Module::express(&tape, input)`,
  the constructors of `Linear`, `Mlp`, `Neuron`, `BatchNorm`,
  `LayerNorm`, `RmsNorm`, `Conv2d`, and `Dropout` take `&Tape`,
  `Optimizer::step(&parameters, &gradients, &rate) -> Parameters`
  (with `AdamW::step_where`'s policy now `FnMut(Symbol, &Data) ->
  bool`), and the checkpoint pairs are plain `Parameters` transforms
  (`snapshot(&parameters, &module)`, `restore(..) -> Parameters`,
  and the named twins) — the internal restore hack that forged a
  generation through a zero-gradient update is gone.

### Removed

- The identity protocol and everything it existed to arbitrate:
  branches, the tip claim, witnesses, chain agreement, `Misbinding`,
  `Network::compacted`, generation vocabulary, `Network::clone`
  forks, the `ValueRef` trait (no API accepts both a `Value` and a
  `Symbol` anymore), and the notebook leak apparatus
  (`Network::leaked`/`leak`) — owned `Tape`/`Network`/`Parameters`
  values move cell to cell and symbols are the cross-cell currency.
  What remains of graph identity at runtime is origin equality plus
  coverage: two integer compares.

- The consumer-less quarter of the neural tier, retired by the
  post-split audit under the consumers-before-machinery rule:
  `Neuron` (the scalar teaching block no example used), `Residual`
  (whose target consumers hand-roll pre-norm skips it cannot
  express), `BatchNormInference`, the module wrappers `MaxPool`,
  `AveragePool`, `Flatten`, and `Reshape` (their Sequential-composed
  convnet consumer never appeared; the `max_pool` free function and
  `Value::reshape` stay), the `average_pool` free function,
  `Linear::from_symbols` (tying goes through exposed symbols, as
  GPT-2's tied head does), `Activation`'s composed `Identity`,
  `Sigmoid`, `LeakyRelu`, and `Elu` variants (the enum keeps the
  dedicated `Tanh`/`Relu` pair; other activations are caller-side
  compositions, like the GELU example), `Value::broadcast_pair`, and
  `Tape::try_resolve`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- Renamed the crate from `poorgrad` to `topos`. The repository moved
  to `https://github.com/shergin/topos`, the `POORGRAD_*` environment
  variables the examples, tools, and CI honor are now `TOPOS_*`, and
  emitted StableHLO modules open with `module @topos`.

- One compile verb: `Network::compile` takes an explicit `Compile`
  request — `roots` (no root is special; recorded gradient symbols
  compile as ordinary roots), `observe` (extra readable interiors),
  and an optional `engine_backward()` posture that retains what
  `backward` reads — replacing `compile(targets, keep)` and
  `compile_training(loss, keep, Retention)`. The internal per-op
  contract is `Reads` (ending the name collision it shared with the
  public policy), `Plan::can_backward` is the only posture a plan
  exposes, and `describe` prints the posture as `forward`/`retain`.
  Every in-repo consumer migrated in the same change and trains
  bit-identically — the gradings' loss bit patterns are unchanged
  across the break.

- `Evaluation` is now `Run`, and it no longer borrows the network: a
  run owns its frozen structure columns and an identity witness, so it
  can be stashed, moved across threads, and differentiated after the
  generation that produced it is gone. `Network::forward*` and
  `Plan::forward` return `Run<Data>` (no lifetime parameter); `of`,
  `backward`, and `recorded_gradients` are unchanged. Documented under
  Run in `TERMINOLOGY.md`.

### Removed

- Rematerialization. The remat posture traded backward time for
  memory and once won on MNIST (9% less peak RSS than retain-all for
  22% more step time); with recorded gradients landed, the gradings
  measured the recorded route smaller *and* faster than both engine
  postures on both consumers — CIFAR ~337 ms/step and ~1.05 GiB
  against remat's ~414/1.31, MNIST ~78 and ~270 MiB against remat's
  ~98/~330 — so the machinery retired: the drop set, the backward
  rematerializer and its memo, the fused-patch rebuild, and the size
  threshold. Engine-backward plans now always retain what `backward`
  reads; the recorded route is the measured choice when training
  memory matters. Every posture remains bit-exact.

### Added

- `Dropout` and `init::dropout` — mask-fed dropout: the module
  multiplies its input by a declared mask input whose default payload
  is all ones, so an unfed run is the identity and inference is the
  absence of a feed, not a mode; the seeded factory draws
  inverted-dropout masks (`0` or `1 / keep`) host-side, fed per
  training step like any other run state. No RNG enters the graph, so
  seeded replay stays bitwise — held by a masked-training replay
  test — and an emitted training step gains one dynamic argument.
  The transformer act trains with dropout on both residual writes
  (keep 0.9 on the page) and samples through the unfed default.

- The `makemore_attention_grading` example: the transformer training
  joint step recorded twice — rank-2 head loop and batched
  attention, identical payloads and arguments — both emitted to
  StableHLO and timed through one resident XLA server, with the
  in-crate oracle as the envelope. On XLA-CPU the batched recording
  serves ~3% faster (42 `dot_general`s against 48); on XLA-Metal
  (`jax-metal`) both modules return the same wrong loss — red rows
  the harness reports instead of hiding (`TOPOS_ENVELOPE=report`)
  — reproducing the tier-1 finding on training modules. The serving
  script's device placement now falls back when a PJRT plugin
  exposes but does not implement `buffer_from_pyval`.

- Batched matmul: operands of rank above two multiply batched — the
  trailing two axes contract as the plain product, and every leading
  axis is a batch axis, required identical on both operands (no
  broadcast batching; rank-2 behavior is unchanged). The forward
  loops the rank-2 gemm seam over the batch prefix, so the
  accelerated backends and the bf16 accumulator contract are
  inherited and each batch slice is bitwise the rank-2 product of
  that slice — held by an op-level test against a narrowed head
  loop, forward and gradients both. The adjoint closes inside the
  existing op set through `permute`, `differentiate` covers the
  batched case in the bitwise closure suite, and emission lowers to
  `dot_general` with batching dimensions, conformance-run through
  the XLA evaluator.

- The `makemore_mlp_emitted` example — E2, emitted training: the
  `makemore_mlp_compiled` model's loss and recorded gradients
  compiled as one forward-only plan and emitted as a single StableHLO
  function `(parameters, batch) -> (loss, gradients...)`, executed by
  XLA per training step while the host keeps the update loop as plain
  payload arithmetic (parameters never re-enter the tape). The
  emitted result order is pinned by recording one same-shape
  `reshape` alias per gradient in caller order — results are the
  readable set in recording order — and every argument stages
  dynamic, since parameters change each generation. Graded against
  the in-crate oracle trajectory in the same binary: step-0 relative
  drift 6.8e-8, every 500-step window mean equal to four decimals
  over 5000 steps, final window 2.2450 exactly; 0.82 ms/step through
  XLA-CPU against the in-crate plan's 0.39 at this scale.

- The `makemore_mlp_adam` example — the optimizer act: the same
  model, seeds, and batches as `makemore_mlp_compiled`, trained once
  with `Sgd` and once with `Adam`, both curves on one chart; the SGD
  run reproduces that example's losses bit for bit, and Adam
  converges below it (last-500 mean 2.2287 vs 2.2450) at one flat
  learning rate. `TOPOS_GRADIENTS=engine` flips the gradient
  source to the interpreter's backward — losses identical, but the
  moment fields densify: ~16.8 MB peak RSS against the recorded
  route's ~15.0 at makemore scale, confirming that recorded
  gradients (O(1)-constant non-parameter slots) are the natural
  optimizer partner.

- The `cifar10_grading` and `mnist_grading` examples: the same
  convnets trained through the gradient routes — engine backward
  over an engine-backward plan, and recorded gradients
  (`differentiate` plus one forward-only plan over
  `[loss, gradients...]`) — bit-identically under matched seeds, one
  route per process so an external monitor attributes peak RSS
  cleanly. On the measured 300-step runs the recorded route wins
  both axes on both consumers: CIFAR ~337 ms/step and ~1.05 GiB
  against ~379/1.35 (retain-all) and ~414/1.31 (remat); MNIST ~78
  and ~270 MiB against ~89/~365 (retain-all) and ~98/~330 (remat).

- `Network::compacted`: rebuilds the structure columns into private
  arenas that hold only this network's live nodes. A plain `clone` is
  still O(1) and shares the append-only arena — right for train-only
  forks, wrong when siblings record after the fork and pin sibling
  garbage for the lineage. Compaction is O(live nodes), stays in the
  same lineage, and is the explicit unwind for that trade. Documented
  under Arena / Fork / Compaction in `TERMINOLOGY.md`.

### Fixed

- Docs: the train-loop memory contract is stated accurately — parameter
  payloads reclaimed per generation since the parameter store (0.7 era);
  residual arena cost is sibling *structure* after forked recording, not
  weights per step.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- The `evcxr` feature: rich cell output for Evcxr notebooks and the
  Evcxr REPL, and `Network::leaked`/`Network::leak`, which return a
  `&'static Network` so recorded proxies outlive a notebook cell. The
  feature adds inherent methods to existing types and no new
  vocabulary — a notebook drives the ordinary API — and every display
  is a pure `to_html(Theme)` string covered by `cargo test`, with a
  `text/plain` alternative for the terminal REPL. `Value`, `Tensor`,
  `Network`, `Plan`, `Field`, `Evaluation`, and `Symbol` all draw;
  charts come from `malevich`, and `Plan` plots its live volume beside
  the schedule `describe` prints. A companion `evcxr-pixel` feature
  upgrades terminal charts to sixel/kitty images. The idiom, what
  leaking costs, and the rough edges: `NOTEBOOKS.md`.

- The Module composition tier: `Module`, a named, parameterized
  recording function — `express(&network, input)` records through
  the public op surface, parameters held as detached `Symbol`s, the
  cost never reaching a run — with `Sequential` (heterogeneous
  stages behind the sanctioned record-time `dyn`, appended with the
  boxing `then`), the path-transparent `Residual`, the shape
  adapters `Flatten` and `Reshape`, module forms of pooling
  (`MaxPool`, `AveragePool`), and implementations for `Activation`,
  `Conv2d`, `LayerNorm`, `RmsNorm`, and `Mlp`. `BatchNorm` gains
  the explicit inference-mode adapter (`inference(mean, variance)`);
  training mode deliberately stays a plain method, because it
  returns the batch statistics and a module must not hide values
  its caller needs. Parameter traversal is `visit` over structured
  `Path`/`Segment` paths (static-literal leaves, integer indices),
  with `parameters` and `named_parameters` derived; programmatic
  access — tying, freezing — uses typed accessors (`weights()`,
  `bias()`, `Linear::from_symbols`), never names.
- Module checkpoints in two identities, with zero engine changes:
  positional `checkpoint::snapshot`/`restore` match by visit order —
  sufficient for resuming the same code — and
  `checkpoint::named_snapshot`/`named_restore` match by structured
  path, which survives code evolution and maps to foreign
  name-to-tensor checkpoints; missing and unexpected paths are loud
  errors. Restoring builds a new network generation through
  `update_each`, so shape mismatches panic through the existing
  validation and nothing mutates; weight tying round-trips.

- `Bf16`, the brain-float payload: a `u16` newtype implementing
  `Differentiable`, `Elementary`, and the scalar-identity
  `Tensorial`, where every operation converts
  to `f32`, computes, and rounds back to nearest-even — the standard
  bf16 semantic, deterministic on every platform. Half the memory of
  `f32`; integers exact up to 256, per the documented `counted`
  contract. `Tensor<Bf16>` and `Network<Bf16>` run the engine
  unchanged, autodiff included — the payload contract holding beyond
  the IEEE singles, with no engine changes at all. Matmul is the one
  documented exception to the per-op semantic: the `Elementary::gemm`
  hook accumulates in `f32` and rounds once per output element — the
  convention bf16 hardware and every mixed-precision recipe follow —
  expanding the operands exactly and riding the accelerated `f32`
  backend chain, with the composed `f32` kernel as the deterministic
  fallback. The everyday numeric traits come along: `Display` and
  `PartialOrd` through the exact `f32` expansion with float
  semantics, `Default` as the additive identity, `From<f64>`
  (rounding once — double rounding through `f32` is exact at bf16's
  precision), and exact widening `From<Bf16> for f64`.
- `ValueRef`, the unified value reference: `Evaluation::of`,
  `Evaluation::backward`, `Field::of` (so `Gradients::of`), plan
  targets (`compile`, `compile_training`, `compile_training_compact`,
  `forward_for`), and `differentiate` accept either a generation-bound
  `Value` or a detached `Symbol`, so the
  `evaluation.of(network.resolve(symbol))` chain collapses to
  `evaluation.of(symbol)` and `compile([loss.symbol()], [])` to
  `compile([loss], [])`. A sealed trait with monomorphized dispatch;
  each form keeps its full validation and panic messages — a symbol
  read on a `Field` checks lineage, branch, and position against the
  field's own chain, the detachment fields were built for. Feed pairs
  and `keep` lists stay `Symbol`-typed so empty list literals keep
  inferring; existing `Value` call sites compile unchanged.
- `Tensor::convert`: storage-preserving element conversion through
  the target's `From` — a constant stays a constant, a selection
  stays a selection, and a dense view keeps its layout, so a
  broadcast converts only its distinct buffer elements. The
  precision boundary for mixed-precision work: loading an `f32`
  checkpoint into a `Tensor<Bf16>` model, or widening bf16 results
  back, priced at one conversion per stored element. Held by an
  end-to-end test recording the same model in both precisions and
  bounding the gradient divergence by bf16 epsilon.
- StableHLO emission for `Bf16`: an `Emittable` implementation
  (`bf16` element type, literals through the exact `f32` expansion,
  bit-pattern hex for the non-finite values), and dtype-aware
  conformance tooling — the evaluator scripts read each argument's
  element type from the module's own `@main` signature, feeding the
  reference interpreter through parsed dense literals and XLA
  through `ml_dtypes` arrays. The execution envelope is per-case,
  scaled to the element type's epsilon, since bf16's 2^-8 cannot
  live under an `f32`-shaped fixed tolerance. Accumulation is IR
  semantics, never an implementation's private choice: `Emittable`
  gains `ACCUMULATION` (bf16 declares `f32`), and matmuls and fused
  convolutions of such an element emit the wider result type with an
  explicit `stablehlo.convert` back — exactly what the home gemm
  seam computes.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `Layer` is gone, replaced by the *unfused* `Linear` —
  the affine transform alone, with activation as its own composition
  stage, unlocking the orderings a bundled activation forbids
  (pre-norm blocks, activation-before-projection). `Mlp` keeps its
  constructor and its bit-identical recordings as the convenience
  over `Linear`.
- **Breaking**: the compile facade loses its fork —
  `compile_training_compact` is gone, and `compile_training` takes an
  explicit `Retention` policy (`All` or `Compact`) as its third
  parameter. The policy is a closed set of alternatives, so per the
  facade rules it is a plain `Copy` enum chosen at the call site, with
  each variant's measured trade documented on the variant instead of
  split across two method docs. `Symbol::from(value)` /
  `From<Value> for Symbol` also lands as the conversion form of
  `Value::symbol`, for lists that must be homogeneous in `Symbol`.
- **Breaking**: `Differentiable` gains the accumulation contract —
  `type Accumulator` with `promote`/`demote`. Matmul inner products
  (every path, including the composed fallback a constant operand
  takes), the sum reductions, `fold`, and `scatter` promote each
  term, accumulate there, and round back once. The IEEE singles
  accumulate in themselves (`Accumulator = Self`, bit-identical and
  bench-checked); `Bf16` accumulates in `f32`, which closes the
  representation dependence a gemm-hook-only contract left open.
  Emission follows the contract: add-reduces, `fold`, `scatter`,
  and the reduces inside the fused `log_sum_exp` and `log_softmax`
  decompositions emit the declared accumulation type with explicit
  converts whenever the element names one.
- **Breaking**: `Tensor::iter` yields owned elements instead of
  references (`Item = Element`, under the `Clone` bound every real
  element type already satisfies), and `PartialEq for Tensor`
  gains the same `Clone` bound. The reference bought nothing: for
  the numeric payloads both spellings compile to the same load, and
  a storage representation that computes its elements has nothing
  to lend a reference to. Callers migrate by deleting `.cloned()`
  or `.copied()` after `iter()`.
- `malevich` moved from a dev-dependency to an optional dependency
  behind the `evcxr` feature, and both entries moved from 1.12 to
  1.15.0, whose public `evcxr` module supplies the stdout protocol and
  the card background topos's own cards are drawn on — the same two
  a `Plot` paints itself with, so a tensor table and a chart in one
  notebook cell cannot disagree. A default build's dependency tree is
  unchanged.
- The `gpt2` example reads JSON through `serde_json` instead of a
  hand-written parser: the safetensors header is a derived struct and
  the vocabulary a `HashMap<String, usize>`, retiring 248 lines of
  parser that taught nothing about autodiff. GPT-2's byte-level BPE
  and the safetensors layout stay hand-rolled and in view — the
  dependency reads the syntax, never the algorithm. A dev-dependency
  only, and no new crate in the tree: `criterion` already brought
  `serde_json`.
- The `gpt2` example rebuilds on the module tier, closing the
  design's proof milestone: the model is a `model.rs` module tree —
  blocks as structs of `Linear`s and `LayerNorm`s around a custom
  attention module, stacked in a `Sequential`, the tied head read
  through a typed accessor — and the bespoke construction-time
  loader is gone, replaced by one `checkpoint::named_restore` over
  the paths the tree announces itself: `visit` mirrors the
  checkpoint's own layout (`h.{i}.attn.c_attn`, `ln_f`), so the
  adapter shrinks to the leaf spellings. The tree is generic over
  the element type, which is the new `bf16` engine — the identical
  modules over `Tensor<Bf16>`, the checkpoint converted at the
  precision boundary, 341 ms/token against the f32 tape's 195. The
  XLA engine's static arguments now come from the positional
  `checkpoint::snapshot`, whose visit order is recorded to match the
  emitted argument order.

### Fixed

- The sealed-trait `private_interfaces` warnings on `cargo check`.
  They were harmless to a normal build and fatal to a notebook: Evcxr
  determines a cell's variable types by parsing rustc's output and
  treats a dependency's warnings as a compilation failure, so any
  warning here broke every cell that bound a variable of a topos
  type.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- The `Optimizer` trait with `Sgd`, `Adam`, and `AdamW`: a
  training-step strategy is a uniform, object-safe slot the loop can
  hand any implementation — deliberately an open trait, not a closed
  enum, so custom optimizers have the same standing as the built-in
  ones. Hyperparameters are single-value payloads written at the
  call site; Adam carries its moments as `Field`s and its
  bias-correction powers as payloads (exact, no `powf`); AdamW
  applies decoupled decay under a structural default policy (rank
  two and above decays; biases and norm gains are spared) with a
  `step_where` predicate override. Optimizer steps are pure field
  algebra: identical runs are bit-identical, and fields from
  `recorded_gradients` drive the same trajectory as the engine's
  backward, held by tests.
- `Network::update_each`: the identity-aware update — the rule
  receives the parameter's `Value` besides its payloads, so
  per-parameter policy (selective decay, clipping, logging) reads
  the parameter's symbol, shape, or rank at the call site. `update`
  now accepts `FnMut` and delegates to it.

### Changed

- `Field::scale` takes a single-value factor and spreads it to each
  entry's shape through `broadcast_to`-style broadcasting — the
  scalar arithmetic optimizer state needs. Scalar fields scale
  exactly as before; tensor fields gain the case that previously
  panicked. The factor is now passed by reference, and the method
  requires the `Tensorial` payload contract.

- `Network::differentiate(loss, wrt)`: reverse-mode differentiation
  as a tape-to-tape transform. Gradients record as ordinary computed
  nodes — compilable, emittable, readable, and differentiable again
  (higher-order derivatives work by re-application; relu Hessians
  are exact zeros). The transform runs the engine's own derivative
  rules over a recording payload, so derivative knowledge cannot
  fork, and it mirrors the engine scan's seed and accumulation
  order: a compiled plan over `[loss, gradients...]` reproduces
  `Evaluation::backward` bitwise, held by per-variant closure tests.
- `Evaluation::recorded_gradients`: assembles the update direction
  from recorded gradient values — the bridge from `differentiate` to
  `Network::update`, so a training step is one forward run of a
  compiled `[loss, gradients...]` plan with no backward pass. The
  `makemore_mlp_compiled` example is that loop: bit-identical to
  `makemore_mlp` under matched seeds (the closure suite pins the
  routes bitwise), at speed parity and a measurably lower memory
  peak, because forward-only liveness frees what the gradient
  computation no longer needs.
- `Activation::gain` and `init::scaled`: the principled link between
  a layer's nonlinearity and its initialization. Each activation
  states the standard factor by which it shrinks a unit-variance
  signal, and the gain-parameterized fan initializer compensates it —
  `init::scaled(seed, activation.gain())` is the general form behind
  the named classics, which stay frozen (`kaiming` is the relu gain;
  seeded outputs never change).
- `Activation::Sigmoid`, `Activation::LeakyRelu`, and
  `Activation::Elu`, with the public `Activation::express` that
  records each variant's expression: the new three are short
  compositions with stable spellings — sigmoid through the fused
  `tanh`, leaky relu and ELU through `maximum` with correct
  subgradients at zero and no overflow at finite extremes — and
  their gradients are the chain rule, closed under `differentiate`
  like every composition.
- `Value::step`, `Value::fold`, and `Value::scatter`: the three
  adjoints that close the op set under differentiation (the
  `maximum` family's locally constant mask, `unfold`'s adjoint, and
  `gather`'s), each with its StableHLO lowering — `step` as
  `compare` plus `select`, `scatter` and `fold` as contractions —
  and emission conformance coverage, including a differentiated
  module in the E2 shape verified against the reference
  interpreter.

- `Value::logsumexp` as a fused operation: the max-shifted reduction
  is finite for every finite operand, with the softmax as its
  gradient, replacing the composition over `log_softmax` that
  returned `inf` once finite logits differed by more than the
  representable range. It lowers to StableHLO as its shift-form
  decomposition and joins the emission conformance suite.

### Changed

- `cross_entropy` composes the expanded form
  `((targets.sum_along(1) * logsumexp(logits)).sum() -
  (targets * logits).sum()) / targets.sum()`: exact mathematics,
  and no term can evaluate `0 * -inf` into `NaN` for finite extreme
  logits. The targets' domain (finite, nonnegative, positive total
  mass) is now documented. Loss values may differ from 0.8.0 in the
  last bits, as any re-associated float expression may.

### Fixed

- The 0.7.0 deep-audit invariant batch: plans take one snapshot for
  validation and execution and reject a shorter sibling that does
  not contain their graph prefix; scalar payloads reject recorded
  shapes they cannot carry, `backward` checks the recorded target
  shape besides the payload's, and debug runs assert every rule's
  output shape against the recorded column; `counted`, `selection`,
  and the private constructors prove the tensor invariant at
  construction; `scatter` validates the adjoint contract instead of
  silently discarding gradient rows; a single-window `unfold` no
  longer overflows its unused stride in debug builds; the backend
  seams check the length of every `Elementary::map`/`gemm` answer;
  and the CUDA pool loads `cudaFree`, frees above-cap buffers on
  return, returns buffers through an RAII loan on every error path,
  and caps its parked bytes.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- StableHLO emission, the crate's first exit to the XLA world:
  `Plan::emit_stablehlo` serializes a forward plan as a textual
  StableHLO module — parameters then inputs as `@main`'s arguments,
  the readable set as the result list, leaves as dense constants.
  Lowering is near-1:1 over the whole op set; the fused
  `log_softmax` decomposes into its stable shift form, the one-hot
  `gather` becomes a `dot_general` against the selection (which
  crosses the boundary as its dense matrix), and `unfold` lowers to
  a static gather as a documented completeness fallback. Matched
  window-GEMM fusion groups raise to `stablehlo.convolution` — the
  pattern library earning twice, fused executor at home and the
  richer op abroad. A typed builder owns every fragment of MLIR
  syntax; nothing heavier than string building enters the crate.
- Emission conformance, two tiers riding external toolchains the
  crate never links: `TOPOS_STABLEHLO_VALIDATOR` names a parser
  and `TOPOS_STABLEHLO_EVALUATOR` an executor (scripts under
  `tools/` serve both from any Python with `jax`), and the suite's
  round-trip and execution tests check every emitted module against
  the plan's own results, passing vacuously without a toolchain.
  Verified beyond the reference interpreter on real backends:
  compiled XLA-CPU runs the emitted batch-8 CNN probe eleven times
  faster than the plan (0.24 against 2.6 ms), and Apple's
  experimental `jax-metal` plugin runs all five conformance modules
  on the GPU within the oracle envelope. Numbers and readings in
  ACCELERATION.md.
- `broadcast_to` and `broadcast_pair`: explicit broadcasting under
  the right-aligned NumPy rule as composites over the named
  expansions — the target shape is always written, never inferred
  by an operator, and the gradient is the chain rule over the
  existing adjoints.
- `concat` and `stack`, the designed route: `concat` sums each
  value zero-padded to the combined extent at its offset (each
  operand's gradient is its own `narrow` window back), `stack`
  lifts through `unsqueeze`. Consumer-shaped tests close the
  transformer rung's other gaps by composition: masked axis-aware
  softmax is a broadcast additive mask before the existing axis
  softmax, and multi-head attention is a loop of rank-2 heads
  joined by `concat` — no batched matmul.
- The `makemore_transformer` example — the attention act: a
  one-block pre-norm transformer over eight characters of context.
  The batch packs its samples into one token row so each head's
  attention is a single rank-2 matmul pair under a block-diagonal
  causal mask (the sequence-packing idiom); heads join through
  `concat`, prediction rows come back through a one-hot `gather`,
  and `RmsNorm` feeds both residual branches. Mean minibatch loss
  2.205 against the MLP act's 2.2450, on a 179-node tape, 5000
  steps in 12 s.
- Elementwise map kernels on the `metal` backend: `exp`, `ln`,
  `sqrt`, and `tanh` as one-thread-per-element GPU kernels in the
  same compiled library, pooled buffers, and poison contract as the
  GEMM path. Measured on the M1 Pro, the GPU passes the scalar path
  near 128k elements and vForce near 512k (2.7 against 1.2 Gelem/s
  at 8M), so the map chain runs Metal first — the reverse of the
  GEMM order — with a size gate that adapts to whether `accelerate`
  is compiled behind it.
- The `broadcast` bench group, measuring elementwise operations
  over broadcast views against their materialized twins.

### Changed

- Broadcast views compute at slice speed: binary elementwise
  operations walk same-shape dense operands by innermost runs (unit
  stride as a slice, zero stride held for the run), and elementwise
  maps over a broadcast view transform only the distinct elements
  and keep the layout — a view in, a view out, and the backend seam
  reads the contiguous window. Bias-style adds over 2M elements
  went from 0.17 to 7.6 Gelem/s; a transcendental over a broadcast
  row computes its 1k distinct elements instead of 2M.
- Reshapes that only insert or remove extent-1 axes keep strided
  views as views, so a multi-axis `broadcast_to` records no
  intermediate copy: squeeze and unsqueeze of a broadcast view are
  layout edits, not materializations.

### Fixed

- A transposed view's elementwise map could reach the backend seam
  through the new window path (its window is exactly as wide as its
  volume), silently replacing the documented bitwise scalar
  fallback for non-contiguous views under `accelerate`. The window
  path now requires a strictly narrower window: only broadcast
  views, which compute fewer elements, earn staying views.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- The `makemore_mlp_batchnorm` example — makemore's third act: the
  character MLP with its hidden preactivation batch-normalized
  before the tanh, the hidden bias retired in favor of the learned
  shift, running statistics maintained in the loop from the batch
  statistics the training plan's keep-set exposes, and the
  single-row sampling twin fed those estimates per draw. Final
  loss matches the plain MLP at this shallow depth, as the lecture
  it follows predicts: the norm buys robustness, not loss.
- Window-GEMM fusion, the plan tier's first pattern: plans
  recognize the canonical im2col chain feeding a `matmul` and
  execute it as one `Tensorial::windowed_product` call, never
  materializing the chain. Matching is structural and
  provenance-blind, keep-set nodes are fusion barriers, and fusion
  follows the plan's memory posture — forward-only plans always
  fuse, compact training plans fuse (backward rebuilds patches
  with one `windowed_patches` fast fill, bit-identically), and the
  default retain-all training plan stays unfused, because per-step
  patch re-allocation in backward measured as a peak-RSS
  regression on the deeper consumer. Profile-driven: the CIFAR-10
  step was ~50% strided-view iteration and materialization, under
  2% elementwise arithmetic — which also retired the planned
  elementwise-chain and `MaxAlong` fusions as worthless. The MNIST
  example's compact training dropped from 114.6 to 106.8 ms/step
  at unchanged memory, with byte-identical output.
- `Tensorial::windowed_product` and `windowed_patches`: the im2col
  product and its patch-matrix half as payload calls, with composed
  defaults that are the bitwise references and a `Tensor` fast path
  that fills patches in contiguous runs instead of the general
  odometer walk. The descriptors are the method arguments, so
  payloads and backends never see graph structure.
- Rematerialization, opt-in via `compile_training_compact`: the
  plan drops its large intermediates (im2col patches, padded
  copies, pooling lanes — the allocator's page-returning size
  class) right after their last forward consumer, and `backward`
  recomputes them on demand, memoized with prompt eviction and
  bit-identical gradients. The trade is explicit because it does
  not always win — measured at 9% less peak RSS for 22% more step
  time on the MNIST example, but negative on the deeper CIFAR-10
  stack, where gradient cotangent buffers dominate; the default
  `compile_training` stays retain-all. `describe` reports the drop
  set and the remat peak either way.
- The retention contract: every operation now declares which
  payload values its derivative rule reads (both operands for
  `mul` and `matmul`, its own output for `tanh` and `log_softmax`,
  the selection for `gather`, nothing for the view family — whose
  backwards read shapes that placeholders answer). Training plans
  use it to compute and report their memory *floor* — on the MNIST
  convnet, 3.3M of 12.3M elements (3.75x) is releasable with
  gradients still bit-identical, which tests prove by forcing the
  releases. Training runs do not execute the releases by default:
  A/B measurement showed per-step mid-run freeing regresses peak
  RSS under the system allocator (fragmentation), so the floor
  awaits rematerialization or arena reuse — while forward-only
  plans keep executing theirs, where the win is measured.
- `Plan`, `Network::compile`, and `Network::compile_training`: the
  first lowering tier. A plan is a compiled execution schedule —
  dead-node elimination against declared targets, a keep-set that
  alone answers reads, and (for forward-only plans) buffer liveness
  that frees every intermediate after its last consumer. Plan runs
  are bit-identical to the interpreter's, survive every `update`
  generation (compile once, train forever), and refuse `backward`
  unless compiled for training, so freed buffers can never leak
  into gradients. `Plan::describe` renders the schedule: per-node
  liveness spans and the static peak-live-volume estimate. The
  MNIST example runs on plans — compile-once training plus a
  forward-only probe whose liveness cuts its live volume 6.8x
  (28M of 191M elements) and the process peak RSS by 31%, with
  byte-identical output.
- The `cifar10` example: a three-stage VGG-style convnet on real
  32x32 color images, the plan tier's pressure consumer. One
  training plan serves all 2000 generations, and the forward-only
  probe plan holds the 500-image accuracy probe's live volume 8.8x
  below retain-all. Reaches 65.2% test accuracy (chance is 10%)
  in about 13 CPU minutes at 392 ms/step; downloads and caches the
  binary archive on first run.

- `Tensorial::unfold` and `Tensorial::fold`: single-axis sliding
  windows (torch semantics, with a dilation parameter) as a strided
  view over the shared buffer, and their adjoint — each source
  position sums its own window contributions in window order, so
  folding is deterministic under any evaluation strategy. The
  substrate for convolution and pooling. Breaking for custom
  payload implementations, which must add both methods.
- `Value::pad` and `Value::unfold`: the corresponding recorded
  operations. `pad` places a value inside zeros along one axis and
  is `narrow`'s adjoint (each is the other's gradient rule);
  `unfold` records the sliding-window view with `fold` as its
  gradient, so overlapping windows accumulate correctly.
- `conv2d` and the `Conv2d` layer: 2-D convolution as a composed
  formula — padding, two unfolds, and an im2col reshape feeding one
  rank-2 `matmul` on the accelerated GEMM path — with stride and
  symmetric zero padding, torch-shaped weights, and the gradient
  from the chain rule alone.
- `max_pool` and `average_pool`: spatial pooling over the same
  window view; the maximum folds with the left-biased binary
  `maximum`, so ties route deterministically to the earliest
  window position.
- The `mnist` example: a LeNet-style convolutional network trained
  on MNIST through the composed convolution and pooling formulas —
  the convolution rung's first consumer. It downloads and caches
  the IDX files on first run and reports test accuracy, per-step
  time, and the loss chart.
- `Network::forward_for`: the target-sliced run — it evaluates only
  the ancestors of the declared targets, leaving every skipped slot
  an O(1) shape-correct placeholder that `of` and `backward` refuse
  to answer with, so skipped reads fail loudly. Sliced gradients
  drive `update` soundly (a parameter outside the closure receives
  its true gradient, zero), and results are bit-identical to full
  runs. With the training and evaluation expressions sharing one
  tape, the MNIST example dropped from 517 to 95 ms per step
  (5.4x) with an unchanged 98.22% test accuracy. Every example
  loop now slices its runs the same way; the makemore family
  reproduced byte-identical output after the switch.

- `BatchNorm`: batch normalization at tensor granularity over
  `[batch, features]` values. `express` records the training mode —
  normalization by the batch's own mean and biased variance — and
  returns a `Normalization` carrying the output and the statistic
  values; `express_with` records the inference mode over statistics
  supplied as values, fed per run, so running estimates live with
  the training loop rather than on the tape.
- `LayerNorm` and `RmsNorm`: the stateless normalization siblings,
  taking per-sample statistics along the feature axis — full
  standardization with a per-feature affine, and root-mean-square
  re-scaling with a per-feature scale, respectively. No running
  estimates and no training/inference split: one recorded
  expression serves both. All three norms share one epsilon
  contract: a single-value constant broadcast in-graph to the
  variance's shape.
- `Value::mean_along`: the mean-reduction composite, `sum_along`
  divided by the reduced axis's extent.
- `Differentiable::counted`: the shape-derived constant constructor
  — a payload of a given shape holding an integer count — that lets
  composed formulas mint axis extents as payloads. Breaking for
  custom payload implementations, which must add the method.
- The `cuda` feature: large dense `f32`/`f64` products through
  cuBLAS on an NVIDIA GPU, Linux only. The libraries
  (`libcudart`/`libcublas`) are bound at run time by `dlopen`, so
  the build never links them and a machine without the toolkit or a
  device declines at run time; typed setup errors make the GPU
  tests skip only in those two environments and fail loudly on any
  other defect. `Backend::Cuda` joins the diagnostics enum between
  `Metal` and `Simd`. Built blind against the documented APIs and
  not yet validated on NVIDIA hardware: treat it as experimental
  until the first measured run, which will also tune its provisional
  flop threshold.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- The `simd` feature: a portable CPU acceleration backend over the
  `matrixmultiply` crate's tuned, single-threaded microkernels with
  runtime instruction-set dispatch (AVX-512F, AVX2+FMA, AVX, NEON).
  It accelerates dense `f32` and `f64` products on every platform —
  the acceleration story for Linux — and sits last in the chain on
  macOS. `Backend::Simd` joins the diagnostics enum, and the ubuntu
  CI job now executes the backend grid it used to only compile.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- `backward` no longer runs the derivative rules of operands used
  only as shape or index data (a broadcast's reference, a gather's
  selection): a `None` cotangent no longer marks its operand as an
  ancestor, so a singular expression behind such a reference cannot
  leak `NaN` into unrelated gradients (audit finding PG-001).
- `narrow` rejects zero-length windows at both the recording and
  payload boundaries instead of manufacturing the empty tensors the
  payload forbids by construction (audit finding PG-002).
- `narrow` and `pad` compute their window ends with checked
  arithmetic, so an overflowing `start + len` fails identically in
  debug and release builds instead of wrapping past the range check
  in release (audit finding PG-005).
- The Metal test grid and the backend status test skip only when the
  machine has no Metal device; every other setup failure — a shader
  that does not compile, a missing kernel, a rejected pipeline — is
  now a hard test failure instead of a silent skip (audit finding
  PG-006).
- `cargo test` no longer executes the Criterion benchmarks: the
  bench targets set `test = false` and CI names its test targets
  instead of `--all-targets` (which implies `--benches` and forces
  them regardless), with doctests run explicitly (audit finding
  PG-007).
- Documentation drift: the README's unsafe-code claim now names the
  default build, the `Tensor` storage list includes the one-hot
  selection, operand links are attributed to the tape's operand
  column, and the accelerate module no longer claims to be the only
  unsafe code in every build.

### Added

- Add dense-payload twins of the `tensor-regression` run benches:
  the existing cases build their payloads with `Tensor::filled`,
  which is constant storage and bypasses the dense matmul and slice
  paths, so the new cases are the ones that price the accelerated
  tiers.

### Changed

- Shrink the metal kernel's staging depth (BK 16 to 8) with a
  banded epilogue: six threadgroups stay resident per core instead
  of three, measured worth a few percent (~1.45 TFLOP/s at
  2048-square); wider 64x128 tiles measured no better and were not
  kept.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Give the elementwise paths slice fast lanes: `map` and `zip` over
  contiguous dense buffers (and dense-with-constant pairs) run
  straight over slices instead of the per-element iterator
  dispatch, which measured 40x below memory speed. Dense multiplies
  went from 235 Melem/s to 5.7 Gelem/s and the gradient seed's
  constant-plus-dense add to 12.8 Gelem/s on an M1 Pro; a wide
  accelerated training step dropped from 112 ms to 19 ms. Every
  lane hands the combiner the same pairs in the same order, so
  results stay bit-identical across lanes, pinned by a test.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-08-02

### Documentation

- Add ACCELERATION.md: what each build supports, how routing and
  determinism work, the safety layering, the seam for payload
  authors, and every measured number; the README's acceleration
  section moves up beside the design bet and shrinks to the claim,
  the one command, and a pointer.

### Fixed

- Skip the metal GPU tests on machines without a Metal device (the
  virtualized CI runners), reporting the skip instead of failing:
  the backend already declines cleanly there, and the tests now
  honor the same contract.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Add the elementwise acceleration seam: `Elementary::map` offers a
  whole-buffer transcendental (`MapOperation`: `exp`, `ln`, `sqrt`,
  `tanh`) to the backend chain, and the tensor's elementwise
  operations consult it for contiguous dense buffers before the
  scalar path. The `accelerate` feature answers through vForce's
  vectorized transcendentals; measured on an M1 Pro, a wide
  training step dropped from 145 ms to 112 ms — the scalar `tanh`
  wall — with strided views and small buffers keeping the scalar
  path bit-for-bit.

### Changed

- Specialize the metal backend's pipelines per shape: the tiled
  kernel's dimensions and strides bake as Metal function constants,
  one cached pipeline per recurring shape (record-once training
  replays a handful), with the generic params-driven pipeline as
  the fallback past the cache cap.
- Raise the metal kernel's occupancy threefold: a GPU-counter trace
  showed the dedicated output-staging tile capping compute
  occupancy at one resident threadgroup per core, so the epilogue
  now reuses the operand staging area as a half-tile buffer in two
  coalesced passes, cutting the threadgroup footprint from 26.9 KB
  to 9.5 KB. Together with the per-shape pipelines, measured on an
  M1 Pro at 2048-square: 534 to about 1400 GFLOP/s.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Add the `metal` feature: large dense `f32` products (Metal has no
  `f64`) run on the GPU through hand-written simdgroup-matrix
  kernels — no MPS, no vendor library — compiled from source at
  first use, with shared-mode buffers from a size-classed pool on
  unified memory. The kernels read operands through the task's
  strides, so transposed, narrowed, and broadcast views pass through
  without copies. Accelerate leads the chain where both features are
  compiled (it measured ahead at every size), so Metal serves the
  stride patterns BLAS declines and everything large in metal-only
  builds — about twenty times the built-in slice path. A failed
  setup or runtime error poisons the backend into declining forever,
  degrading to slow, never to wrong; `Backend::Metal.status()`
  reports readiness, doubling as warmup for the one-time kernel
  compilation.
- Add the `throughput` example: the acceleration ladder measured on
  a wide dense model — the raw 2048-square product and whole
  training steps — with the dimensions shrinking eightfold when no
  backend is compiled in so the run still terminates.
- Add `init::Sample` and make the initializer factories
  element-generic: `uniform`, `normal`, `xavier`, and `kaiming` now
  produce `Tensor<Element>` for any element implementing `Sample`,
  with the element inferred from the network the closure feeds. The
  generator pipeline stays in `f64` and converts once at the end, so
  the `f64` path is bit-identical to every previous release (pinned
  by a golden-bits test) and the `f32` path is the same stream
  rounded once per element. Context-free factory calls bound to
  nothing now need a type annotation.

### Changed

- Move the tensor examples (`mlp_xor` and the makemore family) to
  `Tensor<f32>`: the field's training dtype, and the one every
  acceleration rung favors. The scalar examples and the crate-root
  doctest stay `f64`, and `f64` tensors remain fully supported and
  tested. The facade example still trains bit-identically to its
  hand-rolled twin from matching seeds.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Add the `accelerate` feature, the backend chain's first resident:
  dense `f32`/`f64` matrix products above a small flop threshold
  route to Apple's Accelerate framework (`cblas_sgemm`/`cblas_dgemm`
  — the AMX/SME matrix units on Apple Silicon, AVX kernels on Intel
  Macs), with transposed and narrowed views mapping to BLAS
  transpose flags and leading dimensions without copies; stride
  patterns BLAS cannot express and small tasks decline to the
  built-in paths. macOS only, zero dependencies, and a safe stub
  elsewhere. The default build is untouched and keeps
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; with the feature on, `unsafe` is
  confined to the backend module under a crate-wide `deny`.
- Add `Backend` and `BackendUnavailable`: the backend diagnostics
  surface, present in every build so no user code ever needs a
  `cfg` — `Backend::ALL` lists the defined backends in chain order
  and `Backend::status` reports `Ok`, `NotCompiled`,
  `PlatformUnsupported`, or a setup/poison reason.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Add the acceleration seam: `GemmTask` describes one dense
  matrix-multiplication job (spanning slices plus per-axis strides,
  so transposed and narrowed views pass through unmaterialized), and
  the provided `Elementary::gemm` offers each task to the compiled
  backend chain before the built-in paths compute. The chain is
  empty until the first backend feature lands, so behavior and
  results are unchanged; custom payload implementations keep the
  default.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Back `Tensor` with a strided layout over an extensible `Storage`
  representation (a shared dense buffer or a non-allocating constant), so
  `transpose` and the broadcasts are O(1) views instead of copies and the
  `backward` gradient seed no longer allocates a zeroed buffer per node.
- Add the view operations `Value::reshape` and `Value::permute` (with the
  `reshape`-based conveniences `squeeze` and `unsqueeze`), each a
  differentiable graph node whose gradient routes back by the inverse view.
  `permute` generalizes `transpose` to any rank.
- Add `Value::narrow` (a slice window along one axis): the forward is an
  O(1) view and the gradient scatters back into the excluded positions as
  zeros.
- Add `Value::gather` and `Tensor::selection`: an embedding-style row
  lookup, `table.gather(selection)`, where `selection` is a one-hot
  `[count, vocab]` input stored as its `usize` indices. The gradient
  scatter-adds into the table only (repeated rows accumulate); the
  selection is data and takes no gradient.
- Add `Value::log_softmax`, a fused, numerically stable log-softmax along
  a named axis (the max-shifted forward cannot be composed from recorded
  operations), and `cross_entropy`, the classification loss composed on
  top of it, normalizing by the targets' total mass — the batch size for
  one-hot targets.
- Add the elementwise operations `Value::sqrt`, `Value::powf`,
  `Value::maximum`, and `Value::relu`, and `Activation::Relu` for layers
  and neurons. The `Elementary` payload contract gains `sqrt`, `maximum`,
  and the 0/1 indicator `step`; `Tensorial` gains the `max_along`
  reduction.
- Add the composite expressions `Value::abs`, `Value::softmax`, and
  `Value::logsumexp` — formulas recorded as several primitive nodes, with
  the softmax pair composed stably on top of the fused log-softmax core —
  collected in a dedicated composition tier beside the single-node opcode
  methods.
- Add the `init` module: deterministic initializer factories (`uniform`,
  `normal`, and the fan-aware `xavier` and `kaiming`, which scale rank-2
  weights from the requested shape and zero rank-1 biases) matching the
  shape-to-payload closures `Layer` and `Mlp` take. Every factory is
  seeded explicitly and owns its generator state, so initialization is
  reproducible without a `rand` dependency.
- Add the `makemore_bigram` example: a character-level bigram language
  model over names — a `[vocab, vocab]` logit table read by `gather`,
  scored by `cross_entropy` on per-run one-hot minibatches, and sampled
  through the composite `softmax`.
- Add the `makemore_mlp` example: the Bengio-style character-level MLP —
  a three-character context embedded by `gather`, flattened by `reshape`,
  and squashed through a hand-rolled tanh hidden layer, with a
  single-row twin expression of the same parameters recorded for
  sampling since input shapes are baked in at recording time.
- Add the `makemore_mlp_facade` example: the same model on the `Mlp`
  facade, training bit-identically to `makemore_mlp` from matching
  seeds. The makemore examples live in `examples/makemore/` (declared
  as explicit example targets) and share their corpus machinery and
  dataset there.
- Add the `makemore_mlp_parallel` example: the same model trained data
  parallel — every step fans shard-shaped forward and backward runs
  across rayon's threads against the shared network, sums the gradient
  fields in a deterministic pairwise tree, and averages, computing the
  full-batch gradient exactly while cutting the wall clock
  several-fold.
- Add the `makemore_embedding_map` example: the MLP with a
  two-dimensional character embedding, rendered in the terminal before
  and after training by a small reusable labeled scatter chart
  (`examples/makemore/chart.rs`) whose marks are the letters
  themselves.
- Add the `gemm` benchmark group: the dense matmul path measured
  across sizes, element types, and transposed operands, reported in
  elements per second — one element per floating-point operation.

### Changed

- Accept `impl Into<Shape>` in `Tensor::new`, `Tensor::filled`, and
  `Value::reshape`: axis literals keep working unchanged, and a `Shape`
  or its reference now passes directly instead of being decomposed into
  an axis iterator. Other iterator sources go through `Shape::new`.
- Use plain verbs consistently for operations: rename `Field::scaled` to
  `Field::scale`, `Network::updated` to `Network::update`,
  `Tensorial::{transposed, permuted, narrowed, padded}` to
  `Tensorial::{transpose, permute, narrow, pad}` and
  `Value::{transposed, permuted, squeezed, unsqueezed}` to
  `Value::{transpose, permute, squeeze, unsqueeze}`; align the internal
  tape, layout, storage, and test helpers with the same rule.
- Make `Gradients` an alias for `Field` rather than a wrapper around it.
  `Evaluation::backward` still returns `Gradients`, but the result is a field
  directly, so `Network::update` and the field algebra take it without a
  conversion.
- Read tensor elements through `Tensor::iter` (logical row-major order),
  `Tensor::as_slice` (a borrowed slice when contiguous), or `Tensor::to_vec`,
  and compare tensors by logical value across storage representations.
- Multiply dense matrices on a slice path: `matmul` now reads dense
  rank-2 operands — including transposed, narrowed, and broadcast
  views — through their layout strides instead of per-element logical
  access, in loops shaped for the compiler's auto-vectorizer. The
  per-element accumulation order is unchanged (seeded from the first
  term), so results are bit-identical to the logical path, which
  non-dense storages keep. Measured on an Apple M1 Pro: 26 GFLOP/s
  `f32` and 13 GFLOP/s `f64` for square products, from 0.41 before.

### Removed

- Remove `Gradients::as_field` and `Gradients::into_field`. Pass the gradients
  themselves instead: `network.update(&gradients, ..)`.
- Remove `Tensor::elements`; use `iter`, `as_slice`, or `to_vec` instead.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Add declared inputs and per-run payload binding through `Network::input`
  and `Network::forward_with`, allowing one recorded graph to evaluate
  different samples concurrently.
- Add `Value::sum_along` and `Value::broadcast_along` for explicit axis-wise
  tensor reductions and broadcasting.
- Add the tensor-native `Mlp` facade and an end-to-end XOR training example.
- Add Criterion benchmarks for recording, execution, training, scaling, and
  memory behavior.
- Add continuous integration checks and finite-difference gradient tests.

### Changed

- Rebuild `Layer` at tensor granularity. `Layer::new` now accepts weight and
  bias payloads, and `Layer::express` accepts and returns one batched tensor
  value instead of slices and vectors of scalar values.
- Store parameter payloads per network generation so updates take
  O(parameters) work while preserving older generations.
- Track fork ancestry in symbols and fields so divergent network branches are
  rejected reliably.
- Restrict backward passes to scalar targets and to the target's ancestors.
- Reorganize internals into engine, neural, and payload modules while retaining
  the crate-root public exports.

### Fixed

- Restore operand shapes when differentiating broadcasts.
- Reject parameter updates whose payload shape changes.
- Reject empty tensors and detect tensor-volume overflow.

### Documentation

- Expand the README and crate documentation around concurrency, inputs,
  generations, tensor operations, layers, and MLPs.
- Add the project logo and refresh the terminology guide.
