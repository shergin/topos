//! The acceleration stack's one relation: an implementer may serve
//! a named formula, at a fidelity, against the oracle.
//!
//! Coverage declares *may* — the [`Backend::coverage`] matrix over
//! [`Formula`] and [`Precision`], with a certified [`Fidelity`] per
//! cell. The offer decides *will* — [`offered`] walks a task's
//! declared chain, admitting each member by fidelity-meets-posture, and
//! every member may still decline (thresholds, stride mappings,
//! device presence). The oracle defines *is* — the reference paths
//! are the substrate every decline falls to, in every build; on a
//! build without backend features every offer answers `None`, the
//! seam's fixed point, not dead code. Each task type carries its
//! formula and precision through the crate-internal `Task` contract,
//! so a task can only walk its own chain. Everything here exists in
//! every build: interrogating the stack never needs a `cfg`.

// Every backend module is compiled in every build: it holds the
// always-answering manifest, and keeps its kernels (with their
// scoped `unsafe` allow) behind the feature `cfg` internally.
