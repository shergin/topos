/// and buffer-shared, view operations that alias a buffer (transpose and
/// broadcast) are always safe: no operation ever writes through an alias.

/// never broadcast implicitly. Broadcasting is available only through
/// [`broadcast_like`](Tensor::broadcast_like) and
/// [`broadcast_along`](Tensor::broadcast_along), and it produces a
/// view rather than copying.
///
/// [`matmul`](Tensor::matmul) requires rank-2 or batched higher-rank
/// operands, and [`transpose`](Tensor::transpose) accepts ranks 0
/// through 2, returning a view. Reductions, explicit broadcasts, and
/// reshaping are rank-general.
