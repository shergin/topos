//! Deterministic initializer factories for neural building blocks.
//!
//! Initialization is caller-owned: [`Linear`](super::Linear) and
//! [`Mlp`](super::Mlp) record whatever payloads they are given and take a
//! shape-to-payload closure at construction. This module manufactures
//! such closures. Every factory takes an explicit `seed` and each
//! returned initializer owns its generator state, so runs are
//! bit-identical forever and concurrent initializers never share state:
//! there is no global generator and no clock.
//!
//! The generator is a splitmix64 — statistical quality suited to
//! initialization, not cryptography. It is carried here in a few lines
//! instead of a `rand` dependency because reproducibility is a feature:
//! a seeded example must not change output when a dependency upgrades,
//! and `rand`'s standard generator is documented as unstable across its
//! versions.
//!
//! The factories are generic over the element through [`Sample`]: the
//! whole generator pipeline (splitmix64, Box-Muller, fan scaling) runs
//! in `f64` and converts once at the end, so the `f64` path is the
//! identity — seeded outputs stay bit-identical forever — and the
//! `f32` path is the same stream rounded once per element. The element
//! is inferred from the network the closure feeds.
