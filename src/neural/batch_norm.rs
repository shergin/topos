/// A batch-normalization layer over `[batch, features]` values (Ioffe &
/// Szegedy, 2015): every feature is standardized and passed through the
/// learned per-feature affine `scale * normalized + shift`.
///
/// For sample `i` and feature `j`, with the statistics taken along the
/// batch axis:
///
/// ```text
/// m_j = mean_i(input[i, j])
/// v_j = mean_i((input[i, j] - m_j)^2)
/// output[i, j] = (input[i, j] - m_j) / sqrt(v_j + epsilon)
///                * scale[j] + shift[j]
/// ```
///
/// The layer records two expressions, mirroring the unfed/fed run
/// split. [`BatchNorm::express`] normalizes by
/// the batch's own statistics — the training mode — and returns them
/// alongside the output, because the statistics are part of the layer's
/// contract: gradients flow through them into the input, and the caller
/// reads their evaluated payloads to maintain running estimates.
/// [`BatchNorm::express_with`] normalizes by supplied statistics — the
/// inference mode. The layer stores no running statistics itself: record
/// them as per-run inputs on the inference expression and keep their
/// exponential moving average in payload land with the training loop, so
/// the tape stays a pure record of the computation.
///
/// Parameters are stored as [`Symbol`]s and resolved when an expression
/// is recorded on the family's [`Tape`], like
/// [`Linear`](super::Linear).
