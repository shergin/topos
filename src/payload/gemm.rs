//! The dense matrix-multiplication job and its slice-path kernels.
//!
//! The logical-access path reads every element through
//! `Layout::storage_index` — a per-axis unravel on each access — which
//! costs two orders of magnitude at any size. These kernels read the
//! same elements through the backing slice with precomputed stride
//! arithmetic instead. They change memory access only, never
//! arithmetic: every output element accumulates its terms in
//! ascending inner-index order, seeded from the first term exactly
//! like the logical path, so the two paths answer bit-identically.
//!
//! There is no explicit SIMD and no dispatch to special instructions
//! here; the loops are shaped so the compiler's auto-vectorizer is
//! *allowed* to emit them. Every output element owns an independent
//! accumulator and the hot loop runs over plain slices, so
//! vectorizing across columns reorders no floating-point sum —
//! vectorization stays legal under strict IEEE semantics, with no
//! fast math and no loss of the bit parity above. On aarch64 the
//! contiguous arm compiles to unrolled NEON multiply/add over the
//! output row, which is why `f32` measures at twice the `f64` rate:
//! four lanes per vector register instead of two.
