/// [`Network::into_tape`](crate::Network::into_tape) round trips —
/// linear extension never moves a recorded node. Take one with
/// [`Value::symbol`](crate::Value::symbol) before sealing the tape;
/// read through it with [`Parameters::of`](crate::Parameters::of),
/// [`Run::of`](crate::Run::of), or [`Field::of`](crate::Field::of),
/// and turn it back into a proxy with
/// [`Tape::resolve`](crate::Tape::resolve) when a network reopens.
///
/// The origin participates in equality and hashing, so equally
/// positioned nodes from unrelated graphs do not compare equal.
