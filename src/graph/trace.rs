/// A payload that records instead of computing: the second
/// interpretation of the derivative rules.
///
/// Every derivative rule is written against the payload traits
/// ([`Differentiable`], [`Elementary`], [`Tensorial`]), not against a
/// concrete number type. `Trace` implements those traits by appending
/// the corresponding node to the tape and answering with a handle, so
/// running a rule with `Data = Trace` emits the rule's computation as
/// recorded graph — which is all
/// [`Tape::differentiate`](super::Tape::differentiate) does. The
/// rules cannot tell the difference, and that indistinguishability is
/// the design: derivative knowledge lives in exactly one place, and a
/// rule change reaches the engine's backward and the recorded gradient
/// alike, because both are the same code.
///
/// Public, the type hands the same trick to callers: an algorithm
/// written once against the payload traits gains a recording
/// interpretation — wrap recorded values with [`Trace::of`], run the
/// generic code, unwrap with [`Trace::value`] — beside its eager runs
/// over `f32` or [`Tensor`](crate::Tensor). What it does not open is
/// new scans over the crate's own derivative rules: the op set and
/// the graph walk stay crate-private, so new AD modes (forward mode,
/// checkpointed reverse) are in-crate transforms until a read surface
/// over the spec lands.
///
/// Two trait members no derivative rule calls panic by design:
/// `counted` (a nullary constructor has no tape to record on) and
/// `max_along` (no recorded operation exists for it). Generic code
/// that reaches either cannot run under `Trace`; the per-variant
/// closure tests keep the crate's own rules inside the recordable
/// vocabulary, so a future rule widening it fails its own test at
/// introduction instead of hiding a latent trap.
