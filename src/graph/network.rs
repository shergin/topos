/// parameter payloads are the caller's [`Parameters`], fed inputs are
/// per-run overlays. Nothing mutates a network, so it is `Send + Sync`
/// with no lock, and any number of threads can run one shared network
/// concurrently through `&Network` or `Arc<Network>`.
///
/// A network is only ever born from a tape ([`Tape::into_network`]),
/// and [`Network::into_tape`] consumes it to reopen recording — the
/// consuming pair keeps one origin's history linear by ownership, so
/// symbols and plans stay valid across every round trip. It is
/// deliberately not `Clone`: a second sealed copy could be reopened
/// into a divergent future, which is exactly what the ownership rule
/// exists to make unrepresentable.
