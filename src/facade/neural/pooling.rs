//! Spatial pooling as a composed formula over the sliding-window view.
//!
//! Max pooling rides the same two single-axis `unfold`s as convolution
//! and needs no reduce opcode of its own: the maximum is a left-biased
//! fold of the existing binary `maximum` over the window lanes, so
//! ties route their gradient deterministically to the earliest lane.
