//! The payload card, for a tensor held on its own.
//!
//! A notebook reaches a bare `Tensor` constantly — a batch, a weight
//! read back out of a generation, a running estimate — so the payload
//! renderer is reachable from the type directly and not only through
//! the values that carry it.

// element types a card can draw and is a rendering detail rather than
// something a caller should bound its own code on. Nothing outside the

// keeps `cargo check` warning-free, which Evcxr requires.
