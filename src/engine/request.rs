/// A compile request: the explicit product of what a plan computes.
///
/// The request names its roots (what must be computed — a loss, a
/// logits head, recorded gradient symbols; no root is special), the
/// extra interior values to observe (readable after a run, alongside
/// the roots), and whether run buffers support the engine reverse
/// scan ([`Request::backward`]). The request never touches the
/// graph: recorded gradients enter as ordinary roots, produced by a
/// visible [`Tape::differentiate`](crate::Tape::differentiate)
/// beforehand, so a request is cheap and re-runnable.
///
/// Roots and observes are detached [`Symbol`]s; a [`Value`](crate::Value)
/// still in scope converts through `Into<Symbol>`, and validation
/// happens when [`Network::compile`](crate::Network::compile) resolves
/// them.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use topos::{Request, Tape};
/// # let tape = Tape::new();
/// # let weight = tape.parameter(1.0_f64);
/// # let loss = (weight * weight).sum().symbol();
/// # let network = tape.into_network();
/// // Pure inference: a forward-only plan over one root.
/// let inference = network.compile(Request::roots([loss]));
///
/// // Engine training: run buffers retain what `backward` reads.
/// let training = network.compile(Request::roots([loss]).backward());
/// assert!(!inference.can_backward());
/// assert!(training.can_backward());
